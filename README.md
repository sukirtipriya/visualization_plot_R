# Treemap
TreeMaps are used to visualize the hierarchical data. As the name indicates, the tree maps are divided into rectangular boxes where the first rectangular box is the root of all the boxes present in the graph, and the hierarchy from most to least valued data is plotted in the TreeMap. In R Programming these maps can be implemented using functions present in ggplot2 and treemapify packages.

# sunburst
Sunburst chart, known by multiple names such as ring chart and radial treemap, is used to visualize a hierarchical dataset. It shows hierarchy through a series of concentric rings, where each ring corresponds to a level in the hierarchy. Each ring is segmented proportionally to represent its constituent details.

# circosbar plot
Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements.

# hclustA dotplot 
hclust is a graphical method that allows the comparison of two protein or DNA sequences and identify regions of close similarity between them. A dotplot is essentially a two-dimensional matrix (like a grid), which has the sequences of the proteins being compared along the vertical and horizontal axes.

# alluvial plot
Alluvial Plots can be a powerfull tool to visualise categorical data. It will group observations that have similar values across a set of dimensions and visualise them as flows. The individual flows can be emphasised through different colouring methods.

# boxplot
Boxplots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles. This graph represents the minimum, maximum, median, first quartile and third quartile in the data set.

# bubble plot
A bubble plot is a scatterplot where a third dimension is added: the value of an additional numeric variable is represented through the size of the dots. (source: data-to-viz). With ggplot2, bubble chart are built thanks to the geom_point() function.

# forest plot
A forest plot arrays point estimates (e.g., mean) and confidence intervals (e.g., 95% CI) represented by whiskers for multiple studies and/or multiple findings within a study in a horizontal orientation.
